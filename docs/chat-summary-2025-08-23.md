Chat summary — CircuitExp1 (session snapshot) Date: 2025-08-23

Overview

This document summarizes the conversation and work performed in the CircuitExp1 repository up to August 23, 2025. The
session focused on making the development environment more robust, debugging rendering issues in the map visualization,
adding developer tooling and debug APIs, and fixing failing tests.

Primary objectives

- Make the dev environment resilient to the Vite fixed-port conflict (use dynamic ports or programmatic launcher).
- Debug and restore visibility of the map's edge/line sprites.
- Improve minimap interactivity (click-to-center, drag-to-pan, resizable) and expose stage viewport controls.
- Implement orthogonal/diagonal (45°) routing attempts to reduce line overlap.
- Fix failing tests (accessibility skip link and CSP assertions) and run full test suite until green.
- Provide a reproducible programmatic dev launcher that picks a free port and spawns Electron.

What was changed (high level)

- Dev orchestration
  - Added/updated a programmatic dev launcher that probes ports and starts Vite programmatically, writes a lock file,
    and spawns Electron with the chosen port.
  - Electron main process (`electron-main.cjs`) contains retry logic when the dev server is not yet ready and sets an
    appropriate dev-mode CSP.

- Rendering & routing
  - `src/visualization/stage/render.ts`: added debug instrumentation (console debug lines), ensured line Graphics
    objects are visible on creation, and passed `allowDiagonal45: true` to the routing draw function.
  - `src/visualization/line-routing.ts`: extended routing parameters to support `allowDiagonal45` and added an attempt
    to produce 45° diagonal segments when conditions allow.

- Minimap & debug API
  - `src/components/MiniMap.tsx`: made the minimap interactive (click-to-center, drag-to-pan, resizable via a corner
    handle) and scaled for devicePixelRatio.
  - `src/visualization/stage/debug-api.ts`: exposed `getViewport`, `panViewport`, and `centerViewportAt` on
    `window.__metroDebug` so the minimap can control the main stage.

- UI, accessibility & tests
  - `src/components/MetroUI.tsx` and CSS: added a visible skip-link for accessibility tests and a `sidebar-collapsed`
    handling for exporter UI interactions.
  - `electron-main.cjs`: adjusted dev and production Content Security Policy (CSP) behavior; temporarily relaxed dev CSP
    to allow Vite inline preamble and HMR during debugging.
  - Fixed failing tests and re-ran the full suite; final reported state: all unit/integration tests passing (35 files
    passed, 3 skipped; 96 tests passing).

Known issues & instrumentation

- Symptom observed: nodes render and zoom correctly, but line/edge sprites were initially not visible.
- Instrumentation steps taken:
  - Added debug logs inside `render.ts` to print parent->child route candidates.
  - Forced Graphics visibility (`lg.visible = true`) on creation to rule out hidden-state issues.
  - Enabled diagonal routing attempts and debug hooks to observe routing candidates in the renderer console.

Status at time of summary

- Code edits have been applied and committed locally in the workspace.
- Tests: full test suite run is green after fixes to CSP and accessibility.
- Dev launcher: programmatic launcher ran previously and observed Vite listening on a dynamically selected port
  (example: 5176). A later automated run was cancelled by the operator before final visual confirmation.
- Remaining manual validation: run the programmatic dev launcher (Vite + Electron) live and visually confirm that:
  - render.ts debug logs appear in the renderer console for route candidates;
  - line Graphics are drawn and visible on the stage;
  - diagonal routing is used where appropriate and reduces overlaps;
  - minimap interactions (click/drag/resize) center and pan the main stage correctly.

Next steps / recommended actions

1. Start the programmatic dev launcher (or run `npm run dev`) and open the Electron window to observe the renderer
   console.
2. Verify that the inline script/style CSP errors are resolved (dev CSP allows Vite preamble). If any preamble detection
   errors remain, temporarily enable `unsafe-inline`/nonce hashes for preamble only and iterate.
3. If lines remain invisible, temporarily draw high-contrast test lines (e.g. bright red, thicker) to isolate drawing vs
   styling issues.
4. Tune diagonal routing heuristics to avoid introducing new overlaps; consider a small unit/integration visual test
   harness that draws deterministic graphs to test routing algorithms.
5. Polish minimap UX (rubber-band zoom, persisted size/position) and wire exporter-close to expand the map area.

Files touched (examples)

- electron-main.cjs — dev/prod load logic, CSP, dev-server detection, retry logic.
- src/visualization/stage/render.ts — render instrumentation, line creation visibility flag.
- src/visualization/line-routing.ts — routing improvements, `allowDiagonal45` flag.
- src/visualization/stage/debug-api.ts — viewport control helpers.
- src/components/MiniMap.tsx — interactive minimap implementation.
- src/components/MetroUI.tsx, MetroUI.css — UI tweaks, skip-link for accessibility.
- scripts/dev-launch-api.cjs — programmatic dev launcher (port probing + electron spawn).

Acceptance criteria for closing this task

- A live dev run (Vite + Electron) shows visible edges between nodes and minimap interactions work.
- The full test suite stays green.
- Dev launcher reliably picks a free port and Electron successfully loads the dev server without CSP preamble errors.

Notes

- Project stack: Electron (main + preload), React 19, PixiJS 8, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, Playwright.
- All project documentation and source files are maintained in English. This summary file is intentionally written in
