# CircuitExp1 Production Deployment Checklist

## Executive Summary

**Cross-reference**: This checklist follows the strict guidelines from `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - all items must be verified
by real code implementation before marking complete. This comprehensive checklist evaluates the CircuitExp1 London Metro
Map-style disk folder visualizer for production readiness. The project demonstrates strong architectural foundations
with Electron, React, TypeScript, and PixiJS, but requires critical security, performance, and operational improvements
before production deployment.

**Current Status: ⚠️ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

## 🎯 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL - BLOCKING]

- **Path Traversal Risk**: Current validation in `ipc-validation.cjs` is insufficient
- **CSP Implementation**: Dev mode allows unsafe-inline which could mask production issues
- **IPC Security**: Missing comprehensive input sanitization
- **File System Access**: Unrestricted access to entire file system

### 2. Performance & Memory Issues [HIGH PRIORITY]

- **Memory Leaks**: Performance tests show 1.5% memory growth over 40 cycles
- **Large Dataset Handling**: No pagination or virtualization for large directories
- **Rendering Performance**: PixiJS optimization needed for >10K nodes

### 3. Testing Coverage Gaps [HIGH PRIORITY]

- **Security Tests**: Limited security test coverage
- **Performance Tests**: Missing load testing for production scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Insufficient end-to-end coverage
